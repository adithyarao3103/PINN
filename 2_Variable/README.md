# PINNs for PDEs in two variables

Most of the physically interesting problems involve differential equations in two or more variables, i.e. in time and space variables. Here we implement the PINNs for solving differential equations in two variables.

We consider the following physical cases: 

### Heat equation in two variables:

[Jupyter notebook](PINN_Heat.ipynb)

We consider the heat equation with the Gaussian initial profile

### Wave equation in two variables:

[Jupyter notebook](PINN_Wave.ipynb)

We consider the wave equation with sine wave boundary conditions.

### Burger equation in two variables:

[Jupyter notebook](PINN_Burgers.ipynb)

We consider the Burger equation with an N-wave initial waveform.
